## Implementation Details

### Activity Logging Format
All activity logs now include:
- User ID
- Activity type (create/update/delete)
- Entity type
- Entity name
- Relevant metadata
- Creation timestamp

### Sorting Implementations
- Offers: Status priority + creation date
- Weekly Reflections: Week date (descending)
- Monthly Check-ins: Year + Month (descending)
- Decisions: Decision date (descending)
- Priorities: Order (ascending)
- Activities: Creation date (descending)

### Data Consistency
- All entities maintain proper user relationships
- All collections are properly initialized
- All IDs are uniquely generated
- All timestamps are properly set and updated
- All optional fields have proper null handling

### Type Safety
- All methods implement IStorage interface
- All entity types match Prisma schema
- All optional fields are properly typed
- All return types are consistent with interface

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding batch operations for better performance
- Consider adding transaction support
- Consider adding cascade delete operations
- Consider adding data validation layer
- Consider adding entity relationships management
