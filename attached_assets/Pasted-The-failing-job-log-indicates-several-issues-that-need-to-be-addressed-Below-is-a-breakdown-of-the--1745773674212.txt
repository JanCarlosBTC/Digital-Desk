The failing job log indicates several issues that need to be addressed. Below is a breakdown of the problems and proposed solutions:

### 1. **TypeScript Errors in `input-otp.tsx`**
   - The following errors occur:
     ```ts
     Property 'char' does not exist on type 'SlotProps | undefined'.
     Property 'hasFakeCaret' does not exist on type 'SlotProps | undefined'.
     Property 'isActive' does not exist on type 'SlotProps | undefined'.
     ```
   - **Solution**:
     - Ensure that `SlotProps` includes the properties `char`, `hasFakeCaret`, and `isActive`.
     - Update the type definition for `SlotProps` or safely access these properties using optional chaining (`?.`) or null checks.

     Example:
     ```tsx
     const char = slotProps?.char;
     const hasFakeCaret = slotProps?.hasFakeCaret;
     const isActive = slotProps?.isActive;
     ```

### 2. **Missing Module Imports**
   - Errors like:
     ```ts
     Cannot find module '../../../../shared/components/molecules/card.js' or its corresponding type declarations.
     ```
   - **Solution**:
     - Verify that the referenced files (`card.js`, `button.js`, etc.) exist in the specified paths.
     - If the files exist, ensure they are correctly exported and their paths are valid.
     - If using TypeScript, add type declarations for these modules in a `*.d.ts` file.

     Example for a type declaration:
     ```ts
     declare module '../../../../shared/components/molecules/card' {
       export const Card: React.FC;
     }
     ```

### 3. **Potential `undefined` Access in `use-keyboard-navigation.ts`**
   - Errors like:
     ```ts
     'nextElement' is possibly 'undefined'.
     ```
   - **Solution**:
     - Add null or undefined checks before accessing these variables.

     Example:
     ```ts
     if (nextElement) {
       // Safely access nextElement properties
     }
     ```

### 4. **Database Role Error**
   - Error:
     ```
     FATAL: role "root" does not exist
     ```
   - **Solution**:
     - Update the database configuration to use a valid role. Ensure that the `DATABASE_USER` environment variable is set to an existing database user, or create the `root` role in the database.

     Example SQL to create the `root` role:
     ```sql
     CREATE ROLE root WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
     ALTER ROLE root CREATEDB;
     ```

### 5. **Missing Export in `auth-service.ts`**
   - Error:
     ```ts
     Module '"@shared/schema"' has no exported member 'User'.
     ```
   - **Solution**:
     - Verify the `@shared/schema` module and ensure `User` is correctly exported.
     - If `User` is not exported, add it to the module's exports.

     Example:
     ```ts
     export interface User {
       id: string;
       name: string;
     }
     ```

### Next Steps
1. Apply the fixes mentioned above and commit the changes.
2. Rerun the workflow to ensure the errors are resolved.
3. If issues persist, investigate further based on the updated logs.
