The failing job encountered multiple errors related to missing TypeScript modules and type declarations as well as a PostgreSQL configuration issue. Here's how to address these problems:

### TypeScript Module Errors
The errors indicate missing modules or type declarations in several files. For example:
- Missing modules like `'../../../../shared/components/organisms/dashboard-panel.js'` and `'../../../../shared/components/atoms/button.js'`.
- Missing exported members like `'User'` from `'@shared/schema'`.

#### Solution:
1. **Verify Paths**:
   - Ensure the file paths in your imports are correct. Use absolute or relative paths based on your project configuration.

2. **Install Missing Dependencies**:
   - Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.

3. **Add Type Declarations**:
   - If the modules are JavaScript files, ensure TypeScript knows their types by creating `.d.ts` declaration files or using `declare module`.

4. **Update TypeScript Configuration**:
   - Modify your `tsconfig.json` file to include the necessary paths and module resolution settings:
     ```json
     {
       "compilerOptions": {
         "baseUrl": "./",
         "paths": {
           "@shared/*": ["shared/*"]
         },
         "moduleResolution": "node16"
       }
     }
     ```

5. **Rebuild the Project**:
   - Run `tsc` to recompile the project and validate if the errors are resolved.

### PostgreSQL Role Error
The error `role "root" does not exist` indicates that a PostgreSQL role named `root` is missing.

#### Solution:
1. **Create the Role**:
   - Connect to the PostgreSQL database and create the `root` role:
     ```sql
     CREATE ROLE root WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
     ALTER ROLE root CREATEDB;
     ```

2. **Update Application Configuration**:
   - Update your database connection configuration to use an existing role or create the required role.

3. **Verify Database Initialization**:
   - Check `.github/workflows/ci.yml` or other initialization scripts to ensure the database setup doesn't rely on a non-existent role.

### Next Steps
1. Fix the TypeScript errors by verifying the paths, ensuring dependencies are installed, and updating `tsconfig.json`.
2. Resolve the PostgreSQL role issue by creating the `root` role or updating the configuration.
3. Re-run the workflow to confirm the issues are resolved. If additional errors occur, provide the updated logs for further assistance.
