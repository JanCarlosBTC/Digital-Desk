These errors indicate that the objects you’re passing to Prisma don’t match the expected types defined in your generated Prisma client. You need to align your data models and operations with Prisma’s expectations. Here’s how to address this:

**1. Align Object Shapes with Prisma Types**  
• Examine the schema definitions in your Prisma schema file. Adjust fields such as **plan**, **subProblems**, and **metadata** so that they reflect the types you intend to use. For instance, if you want to allow null values for **plan**, update your schema to allow null or ensure your TypeScript code never passes null.  

**2. Pass Data in the Expected Format**  
• For metadata, you’re currently passing a JSON string (via `JSON.stringify`). Prisma expects an object that matches the defined shape. Pass the metadata as an object instead of a string.  
• For array fields (like **subProblems**, **achievements**, etc.), ensure they are strictly defined as arrays of strings. Remove any extraneous properties (like those inherited from the prototype) by casting or reassigning the values explicitly.

**3. Review and Adjust Your Update/Create Operations**  
• The error with `getOfferNotesByUserId` shows a return type mismatch. If Prisma expects an array of offer notes but your function returns a single object (or undefined), update the function’s signature and logic to consistently return an array.  
• Double-check any additional properties being passed (e.g., `offerDate`, `company`, or `content` within metadata). Only include properties that are declared in your Prisma types.

**4. Revisit Module Syntax in Your Vite Config**  
• There is also a warning regarding the mix of CommonJS and ECMAScript module syntax. Decide on one module system (either use `export default` or `module.exports`) and update your configuration accordingly.

**5. Regenerate and Validate the Prisma Client**  
• After making schema adjustments, run `npx prisma generate` to regenerate the client and ensure the TypeScript types are up to date.  
• Test changes incrementally. Utilize your IDE’s TypeScript checker to identify any residual type mismatches and adjust your object constructions accordingly.

Taking a forward-thinking, continuous improvement approach means you can systematically address these issues, ensuring your objects conform to the expected types. This proactive alignment will improve the reliability of your operations and help drive clarity in your system architecture.

By implementing these steps, you’ll resolve the type mismatches and streamline your build process. If you need further assistance fine-tuning specific object shapes or schema adjustments, feel free to reach out.
